More news now on the string of illegal parties that have taken place recently in the UK.

Police say they broke up an illegal gathering in Cardiff Bay just after midnight on Friday, following reports of anti-social behaviour involving a large number of people drinking alcohol.

The group was dispersed and no arrests were made, South Wales Police said.

It follows several illegal parties in London - where police have been injured in clashes with revellers - while Liverpool's mayor says people are bringing the city into disrepute by continuing to take part in mass celebrations following Liverpool FC's Premier League win.

Under coronavirus lockdown rules in Wales any number of people from two households can meet up, while in England up to six people can gather from different households. Read our explainer on the rules here.
